# Likert Scale Analysis
Â©Damian Romero

### A toy repo for analyzing Likert-scale data with Python using Jupyter notebooks

For the analysis, I use the plot-likert script from https://github.com/nmalkin/plot-likert
, so if you want to use the notebook(s) here, you will need to download the script from there
and make sure the dependencies work in your system. Otherwise, there are several other resources
some of which can be found here:
